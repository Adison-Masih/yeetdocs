As You Can see, the channel is currently private, that means nobody can see or access it.

To Make It Public, You Can Use The `/tempvoice public` Command, in it choose the `choice` to be `On` if you want to Publicize your channel, or set it to `Off` if you wanna Privatize your channel.

You Might Wanna Restrict Some Users from joining your channel when it is public, to do so, you can just use the `/tempvoice disallow` command.
