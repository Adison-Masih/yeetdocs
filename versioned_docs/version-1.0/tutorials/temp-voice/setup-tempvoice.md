**Temp Voice** Is A Unique Feature Which Helps An User to create a private temporary voice channel when they join a registered channel. The User Will Have Complete Controll Over Their Temp Voice Channel, such as allowing, disallowing an user, making it public / private, changing its name and more!

First You Will Need To Create A Voice Channel. For Instance, We Are Calling It `Join To Create`, Which Is A Pretty Self-Explanatory Title.

## Register The Channel

After The Channel Creation, Run The `/registertempvoice` command, choose the channel that you just created and run it! You Can Also Fill in the second option `role`, provide it with a role, this role will be assigned to the user who owns a Temp Voice Channel, and would automatically be removed from them when their channel is disposed.

:::success TIP
Name The Role Something Like `Temp Voice Host`, which can easily be understood by other members that why has the person been assigned that role!

Now Whenever someone joins the `Join to create` channel, they wil be pushed to a new private channel which is visible only to them currently.
